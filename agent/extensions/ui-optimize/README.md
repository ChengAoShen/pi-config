# UI Optimize

Local Pi UI polish extension installed at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/ui-optimize
```

Pi auto-discovers this directory through `index.ts`. Use `/reload` after editing; if prototype patches look stale, restart Pi for a clean process.

## Features

- Markdown rendering polish for headings, code blocks, lists, quotes, rules, and tables.
- Compact pre-answer activity summaries while tools are collapsed:
  - groups consecutive pre-answer `thinking` and tool-call activity until the next assistant text reply;
  - shows a one-line thinking preview inside the summary;
  - preserves expanded thinking/tool output when the user toggles expansion.
- Image paste workflow:
  - clipboard image/file paths become `[imageN]` tokens in the editor;
  - tokens are rendered compactly;
  - tokens expand back to paths on submit;
  - the editor is installed as a wrapper around any existing custom editor, so it can compose with `command-aliases.ts`.
