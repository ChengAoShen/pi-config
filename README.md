A portable `~/.pi` configuration focused on **fast local iteration**, **low-friction agent workflows**, and **small personal extensions** that make Pi feel calmer and more capable.

## 🧭 What is LazyPi?

LazyPi is my portable configuration layer for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It keeps the parts worth versioning — settings, system instructions, and local extensions — while leaving credentials, sessions, caches, and local binaries out of Git.

The goal is simple: open Pi and work. Long commands can run in the background, independent analysis can be delegated to headless sub-agents, and quick side questions can be asked without polluting the main thread.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🦥 **Personal-first defaults** — simple command aliases such as `exit → /quit` and `clear → /new`.
- 🧵 **Background shell jobs** — start long-running commands, inspect logs, wait for completion, or cancel without blocking the main agent loop.
- 🤖 **Simple headless sub-agents** — launch read-only Pi workers in parallel for research, review, planning, and test analysis.
- 💬 **Ephemeral side chat** — `/side` and `/btw` open a lightweight no-tools overlay for explanations and side questions.
- 📦 **Portable config** — clone into `~/.pi`, install extension packages, log in locally, and restore the working environment.

## 🧩 Included extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent/extensions/command-aliases.ts` | Maps bare editor input like `exit` and `clear` to built-in slash commands. |
| `agent/extensions/background-shell.ts` | Adds `bg_shell_start`, `bg_shell_status`, `bg_shell_wait`, and `bg_shell_cancel`. |
| `agent/extensions/sub-agents.ts` | Adds `sub_agent` for starting, waiting on, checking, and cancelling headless Pi workers. |
| `agent/extensions/side-chat.ts` | Adds `/side` and `/btw`, a temporary explanatory overlay with no tool execution. |
| `agent/extensions/ssh.ts` | Local SSH helper extension. |
| `agent/extensions/todo.ts` | Simple todo-list tool. |
| `agent/extensions/ui-optimize/` | Local UI rendering tweaks. |

## 🛠️ Workflow shortcuts

### Background shell

Use background shell tools for commands expected to take more than a few seconds:

```text
bg_shell_start   start a long-running non-interactive command
bg_shell_status  inspect one job, or list all jobs
bg_shell_wait    wait for a job and collect final output
bg_shell_cancel  terminate a running job
```

### Sub-agents

Use `sub_agent` when a task can be split into independent read-only work:

```text
start       start one headless Pi worker
start_many  start up to 8 workers concurrently
status      inspect worker status
wait        collect worker results
cancel      stop workers
```

Sub-agents default to read-only tools:

```text
read, grep, find, ls
```

They are started with `--no-session --no-extensions` to avoid polluting the main session or recursively creating more agents.

### Side chat

In TUI mode:

```text
/side
/btw why is this implementation structured this way?
```

Inside the overlay:

```text
Enter             send
Esc / Ctrl+C      close
exit / quit       close
↑ / ↓             scroll
PageUp/PageDown   fast scroll
Home / End        jump
```

The side chat is tool-less: it explains, clarifies, and thinks with you, but it does not execute commands or modify files.

## 🏁 Install on another machine

Install Pi first, then clone this repository as your Pi config directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChengAoShen/LazyPi.git ~/.pi
```

Start Pi once, or sync extension packages explicitly:

```bash
pi update --extensions
```
